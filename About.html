        <h2>About Sinag</h2>
        <p>Tribu Sinag Padayon is a group of individuals who shares interest in exploring nature's gift through
          different ways and  means while doing and developing socio-civic and outreach program for our fellow countrymen.
          We aim to give hope, shed light (hence the word Sinag) for a better future and help those
          who are in need to move forward (hence the word Padayon) from any challenges in any way we can.
          <br>
          <p>Tribu Sinag Padayon is an outreach group that is dedicated to helping indigenous people in the Philippines.
        The group was founded with the goal of providing support, resources, and education to those in need within indigenous communities,
        particularly those who have been historically marginalized and disadvantaged.<br><br>
       In addition to education, Tribu Sinag Padayon also provides a range of other services and programs to support indigenous communities.
        These include healthcare services, such as medical missions and health education programs, as well as livelihood programs, such as skills training and microfinance initiatives, to help indigenous people build sustainable livelihoods.
